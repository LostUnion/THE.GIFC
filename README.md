<b>GIFC - Python Program for Converting Multiple Images into a Single GIF File.</b>

GIFTS is a Python program specifically designed to facilitate the conversion of multiple images into a single GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file. This program offers a user-friendly interface and uses the capabilities of a Python library such as Pillow to efficiently solve image processing tasks.

<h4>Key Features:</h4>

1. <b>Image Sequence Arrangement:</b> The program allows users to arrange the order of images before converting them into a GIF, ensuring the desired sequence and flow.
2. <b>Settings:</b> GIFC provides options to customize the GIF file, including the duration of the image frame, according to the user's preferences.
3. <b>Efficiency and Performance:</b> Leveraging Python's capabilities and libraries, GIFC ensuresefficient processing and optimal performance while converting images into a GIF format.
4. <b>User-Friendly Interface:</b> The program offers an intuitive interface, making it accessible for users of varying expertise levels in programming or image processing.

<h4>How It Works:</h4>

1. Users add several images to the program by clicking on the "Add" button.
2. GIFC processes these images by correcting their sequence.
3. Users can set a parameter such as the duration of the frame.
4. It is possible to save the file both to the executable file folder and to any other folder.
